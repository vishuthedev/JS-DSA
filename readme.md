Data Structure:- Data structure is a storage that used to store and organize data. 
A data structure is not only used to organize the data it is also used to processing , retriving and storing the data.


Classification of data structure:- 
We have two type of data structure linear and non linear.

Linear:-A linear data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
Example: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.

Static Data Structure: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
Example: Array.

Dynamic Data Structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
Example: Queue, Stack, Linked List etc.


Non-Linear Data Structure: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
Examples: Trees and Graphs.

Array Data Sructure:- An array is a fundamental data structure that stores elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Each element in the array is accessed by its index or subscript.

Searching Data structure:- 

Linear Search:- It's sequentially check each element of a list until a match found or the end of the list reached .
1. Suitable for small list or unshorted data.
2. O(n) -linear time complexity.

Binary Search:- It's Efficiently search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
1. Applicable for sorted data.
2. O(log n) -logarithmic time complexity.


Sorting Data structure:-

Bubble sort:- Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
1.  O(n^2) in the worst case.

Selection sort:- Divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region, and moves it to the sorted region.
1. O(n^2) in the worst case.

Quick sort:- Chooses a "pivot" element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, such that elements less than the pivot go to one sub-array, and elements greater than the pivot go to the other. The process is then applied recursively to each sub-array.
1. O(n^2) in the worst case, but O(n log n) on average.

Merge sort:- Divides the unsorted list into n sub-lists, each containing one element, and repeatedly merges sub-lists to produce new sorted sub-lists until there is only one sub-list remaining.
1. O(n log n) in the worst case.
